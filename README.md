#### Notes:

Read the local image, process it using a web worker, and display it in your Next.js component.

The worker is like an extra set of hands for your browser. When you give it an image to work on, it performs operations like blurring, resizing, and more without slowing down your main webpage. It runs in the background, making sure your page stays responsive.

imageBuffer is a Buffer. This type represents a sequence of bytes and is commonly used for handling binary data, such as images or files, in Node.js. When you pass this Buffer to the web worker or use it in any image processing operations, it retains its binary format, which Jimp can handle perfectly.

MIME_PNG in Jimp stands for the MIME type for PNG images. MIME types are used to tell browsers what type of file is being sent. So, Jimp.MIME_PNG is just the way Jimp identifies a PNG image file. It ensures the image youâ€™re working with is processed and output as a PNG. This keeps things neat and compatible across different systems and browsers.

jimp.d.ts manually defines the expected types (since some of them appear to be missing from jimp).
